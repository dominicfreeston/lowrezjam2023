This game is currently being worked on as part of the [LOWREZJAM 2023](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2023) game jam, where the main restriction is that canvas size must be 64x64 pixels (scaled up).

There are 10 optional themes, and the ones I'm keeping in mind are: Invasion, Cooperation and Wildfire. But really I already wanted to make a mini bullet hell game, and see if I could make it work with the 64x64 canvas and the GameBoy color palette, so that's what I'm doing.

The game is made with [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game) (version 5.4), which is required to build and deploy the game.
